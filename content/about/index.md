I like to create Solutions based on DevOps Principles. Meanwhile I am creating distributed systems based on Opensource and Microsoft technologies since 15 years, working in different job roles and industry sectors.

So true: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." (Albert Einstein)
